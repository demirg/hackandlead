> Reimaging the bank branch for the digital era.

The Raiffeisen group is a collective of Raiffeisen banks organised in the form of a cooperative, with locations across Switzerland. Their business activities comprise traditional interest-earning business in the form of mortgage lending and credit business, as well as business with customer assets in the form of savings and investments. The Raiffeisen Group is the third-largest banking group in Switzerland and leader in retail banking. 

In fact, the most of customers still want the option of a face to face discussion about their banking needs, and expect that need to remain the same five years from now. But we must reposition our traditional branch model because tomorrow’s banking consumers will take advantage of both digital and physical channels in managing their finances. 

We provide a number of optional API’s to use for the challenge:
