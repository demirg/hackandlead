The Challenge: Reimaging the bank branch for the digital era.

The Raiffeisen group is a collective of Raiffeisen banks organised in the form of a cooperative, with locations across Switzerland. Their business activities comprise traditional interest-earning business in the form of mortgage lending and credit business, as well as business with customer assets in the form of savings and investments. The Raiffeisen Group is the third-largest banking group in Switzerland and leader in retail banking. We must reposition our traditional branch model because tomorrow’s banking consumers will take advantage of both digital and physical channels in managing their finances. 

Give us a sneek peek into your offbeat imagination! We are keen to see a prototype of your mind-blowing vision of «Reimaging the bank branch for the digital era»!
