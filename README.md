Raiffeisen participates in the Hack ’n’ Lead 2017 as Gold Sponsor. On our GitHub repository the hacking teams will find all information they need to join the competition to our challenge.

The Challenge: Reimaging the bank branch for the digital era.

The Raiffeisen Group is the third-largest banking group in Switzerland and leader in retail banking. We must reposition our traditional branch model 
because tomorrow’s banking consumers will take advantage of both digital and physical channels in managing their finances. 

Give us a sneek peek into your offbeat imagination! We are keen to see a prototype of your mind-blowing vision of «Reimaging the bank branch for the digital era»!
